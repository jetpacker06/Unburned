Unburned is a mod for 1.18 forge that adds non-flammable variants of all wood blocks.
Compat for mods like biomes o plenty is planned.
^ Probably. but idrk because each wood type takes forever because each individual block needs an item model, a blockstate file, a line of code, a loot table, and a translation key.
Planning to release a 1.18.1 version to Curse then update to 1.18.2
